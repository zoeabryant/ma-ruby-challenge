## Ruby Challenge
Challenge tackled on Week 8 of the course.

Makers Academy provided questions_spec.rb with tests we are required to pass.

questions.rb contains my solutions.

Extra files are for use in my solutions.

## RSpec!

To run the specs, just run

~~~
$ git clone https://github.com/zoeabryant/ma-ruby-challenge.git
$ cd ma-ruby-challenge
$ rspec questions_spec.rb
~~~

### Rules (as defined by Makers)

* Try and get the RSpec tests to pass (but not by cheating - i.e. hardcoding the expected value)
* You shouldn't need any extra libraries or gems
* The cleaner your code the better!
* Googling is fine as usual
